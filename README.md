# TROIF

A beginner R package containing functions that I find useful in R


# Installation

Download the tar.gz file to your computer. Navigate to the file in R (using `setwd()`) and then install by using:

`install.packages("./troif.tar.gz", repos=NULL)`


# Help

You can get help on the functions within by using the regular `?` command in R. For instance `?drawPlots`
